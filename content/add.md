# Add .gitignore files

You are welcome to add your custom .gitignore files. It's very easy, just follow those simple steps.

* Clone project from [github](https://github.com/jakubgarfield/gitignore-database)
* Add directory to `content\files` with the name of the technology
* Create `index.md` with the description
* Create `raw.gitignore` with the .gitignore file content
  * It's important to name the file according to this
* Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

After that, I'll review your request as soon as possible and add your pull request to production.
